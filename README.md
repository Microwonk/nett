# NETT

A simple networking experiment in C++, using meson (trying it out) and vcpkg for dependencies

NOTE: meson is barely usable compared to cmake, how do people use this
TODO: use cmake instead

# Requirements

- vcpkg
- meson
- cmake
- ninja

# Building

If all requirements are installed, you should be able to just run `make setup`, `make compile` and `make run`.
